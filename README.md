# pillbox_beds_with_heal

This is a modified version of pillbox beds https://forum.fivem.net/t/pillbox-beds

Feature:

Giving +1 health slowly until the player is full in health

Full credit to BUCKO

I only made the healing part


#Changes 26/06-2019

Added a new verion that is standalone so its works on vrp framework


#Changes 25/06-2019

Added so players now get health slowly instead of full health after x amount of seconds

Fixed a bug that made you able to lie in bed and get up again and still get full health
